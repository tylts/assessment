          This is the cover letter I would write to a potential employer. It
          would cover things like stuff I did and other stuff. I would emphasize
          things like this <strong>cool thing I did</strong> and possibly
          <em>this other cool thing I did.</em>
        </p>

          I am <mark>very</mark> interested in this job. Thank you for your
          <span>time</span>.

          This would be another paragraph showing some proof of the things I've
          done, complete with charts and graphs.
